# C++ Basics Repository

Welcome to the **C++ Basics** repository! This repo contains a collection of basic C++ code examples and explanations on fundamental concepts. Whether you're a beginner or just need a quick reference, you'll find simple, easy-to-understand examples for various topics in C++ programming.

## Topics Covered:
1. [Hello World](01_hello-world/): Introduction to basic output in C++.
2. [Data Types and Variables](02_data-types-and-variables/): Understanding the different data types and how to use variables.
3. [Operators](03_operators/): Learn about arithmetic, relational, logical, and other operators.
4. [If-Else Statements](04_if-else/): Decision-making using if-else constructs.
5. [Loops](05_loops/): Repeating tasks with for, while, and do-while loops.
6. [Functions](06_functions/): Organizing code into reusable functions.
7. [Arrays](07_arrays/): Storing and manipulating collections of data.
8. [Pointers](08_pointers/): Using pointers to access and manipulate memory addresses.
9. [Classes and Objects](09_classes-and-objects/): Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
10. [Constructors and Destructors](10_constructors-and-destructors/): Learn how to initialize and clean up objects.

## How to Use:
- Clone the repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-sudoyasir/cpp-fundamentals.git
  ```
- Navigate to any of the topic folders to find the code and corresponding explanations in the `README.md` files.
- Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile and run the `.cpp` files.
