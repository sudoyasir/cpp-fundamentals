# If-Else Statements

`if-else` statements are used to make decisions based on conditions.

## Syntax:
```cpp
if (condition) {
    // code if condition is true
} else if (another condition) {
    // code if another condition is true
} else {
    // code if all conditions are false
}
```

## Code Explanation:
- The user is asked to enter a number.
- `if` checks if the number is greater than 0 (positive).
- `else if` checks if the number is less than 0 (negative).
- `else` runs if the number is exactly 0.

## Output Example:
```
Enter a number: 5
The number is positive.
```
or
```
Enter a number: -3
The number is negative.
```
or
```
Enter a number: 0
The number is zero.
```
```
