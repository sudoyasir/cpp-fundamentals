# Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

## Types of Loops:

### 1. For Loop
Used when the number of iterations is known.

```cpp
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code
}
```

### 2. While Loop
Used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.

```cpp
while (condition) {
    // code
}
```

### 3. Do-While Loop
Similar to while loop, but ensures the code runs at least once.

```cpp
do {
    // code
} while (condition);
```

## Code Explanation:
- `for` loop prints numbers 1 to 5.
- `while` loop prints numbers 1 to 5.
- `do-while` loop prints numbers 1 to 5.

## Output Example:
```
For Loop:
1 2 3 4 5 

While Loop:
1 2 3 4 5 

Do-While Loop:
1 2 3 4 5 
```
