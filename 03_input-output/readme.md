# Input and Output

In C++, input and output are handled using `cin` and `cout`, provided by the `iostream` library.

## Input Functions:
- `cin`: Used to take input from the user.
- `getline(cin, variable)`: Used to read an entire line (including spaces).

## Output Function:
- `cout`: Used to print output to the console.

## Code Explanation:
- `cout` prompts the user to enter their name and age.
- `getline(cin, name)` reads the full name (with spaces).
- `cin >> age` reads the age.
- Then, `cout` displays the entered information.

## Output Example:
Enter your name: John Doe Enter your age: 22
Hello, John Doe! You are 22 years old.
