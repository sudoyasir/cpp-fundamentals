# Hello World

This is the very first and most basic C++ program.  
It simply displays the text `Hello, World!` on the console.

## Code Explanation:
- `#include <iostream>`: Includes the input-output stream library.
- `using namespace std;`: Allows using standard C++ functions without the `std::` prefix.
- `int main() { ... }`: The main function where the program starts execution.
- `cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;`: Prints "Hello, World!" followed by a newline.
- `return 0;`: Ends the program successfully.

## Output:
Hello, World!
