# Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

## Types of Operators in C++:

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Modulus (Remainder)

### 2. Relational Operators
- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

### 3. Logical Operators
- `&&` Logical AND
- `||` Logical OR
- `!` Logical NOT

## Code Explanation:
- Demonstrates how to use arithmetic, relational, and logical operators with examples.
- Shows results printed on the console.

## Output Example:
Arithmetic Operators: a + b = 13 a - b = 7 a * b = 30 a / b = 3 a % b = 1
Relational Operators: a == b: 0 a != b: 1 a > b: 1 a < b: 0 a >= b: 1 a <= b: 0
Logical Operators: x && y: 0 x || y: 1 !x: 0
